# Hand Gesture Virtual Mouse 🖱️🤖  

This project uses **OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pynput** to control a computer mouse using **hand gestures** detected through a webcam. It allows users to move the cursor and perform click actions using finger movements.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Real-time hand tracking with **MediaPipe Hands**  
✅ Cursor movement using the index finger  
✅ Click action by bringing index and middle fingers together  
✅ Smooth and natural control with OpenCV  

## 🛠️ Installation
